This OMEX archive is automatically generated from the selected exposure,
using resources that have been manually exposed, along with any known
linked resources (examples: SED-ML files will pull in all referenced
resources; CellML 1.1 files will pull in their imports through embedded
workspaces on the same PMR instance).

Any resources present in the source workspace but not linked are omitted
from this OMEX archive.

However, if a file is expected to be present in this archive but was
omitted, checked whether or not the source exposure has exposed that
file.  If not and if you feel the curator or the author of the exposure
should have included that resource, please file an issue at the tracker
for data issues pertaining to the repository at:

https://github.com/PMR2/models.physiomeproject.org/issues

Alternatively, if this omitted resource is clearly linked by another
resource present in the archive (e.g. SED-ML or CellML resource that
links or reference to a file present in the workspace but is missing
from the generated archive), it may be that the export system has no
knowledge on how that linkage might be handled, in which case, please
file an issue at:

https://github.com/PMR2/pmr2.omex/issues
